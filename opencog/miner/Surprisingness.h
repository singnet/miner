	/**
	 * Similar to isurp_old but takes into account joint variables.
	 *
	 * For instance the probability estimate of
	 *
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y Z
	 *   And
	 *     Inheritance X Y
	 *     Inheritance Z C
	 *
	 * is the product of probability p1 of
	 *
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y
	 *   Inheritance X Y
	 *
	 * with probability p2 of
	 *
	 * Lambda
	 *   Z
	 *   Inheritance Z C
	 *
	 * This works fine because the two conjuncts are independent,
	 * however, the probability estimate of
	 *
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y
	 *   And
	 *     Inheritance X Y
	 *     Inheritance Y C
	 *
	 * isn't merely p1*p2 because they have one variable in common Y.
	 *
	 * To address that we use the fact that the above pattern is
	 * equivalent to
	 *
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y Z
	 *   And
	 *     Inheritance X Y
	 *     Inheritance Z C
	 *     Equal Y Z
	 *
	 * Then the probability estimate is p1*p2*p3, where
	 *
	 * p3 = P(Y=Z)
	 *
	 * is the probability that the value of Y is equal to the value of
	 * Z.
	 *
	 * To calculate p3 accurately one would need to produce the
	 * distribution over all values that Y can take and the
	 * distribution of over all values that Z can take, then calculate
	 * the inner product of the 2 distributions.
	 *
	 * The problem is that, first, calculating such probability
	 * distribution is expensive, and second, the resulting estimate is
	 * too accurate and thus most pattern are measured as unsurprising
	 * due to the inner product capturing the interactions at the point
	 * of contact of the variable, between the components.  Instead an
	 * estimate relying on the counts alone of values associated to
	 * given variables in given components is derived.
	 *
	 * Let's assume the same variable X appears in n difference
	 * components. Let's call these variable appearences X1 to Xn. So
	 * the goal is to estimate P(X1=...=Xi= ...=Xn).  Let's denote
	 * V(Xi) the set of values that Xi can take when its corresponding
	 * component is matched against the database alone, without
	 * any interaction of the other components. Thus |V(Xi)| is the
	 * number values that Xi takes in that standalone component.
	 *
	 * Let's now take into account the syntactic specialization
	 * relationships between each component relative to a given
	 * variable. Formally component A is syntactic specialization of
	 * component B relative to variable X, if B is a subtree of A where
	 * all variables but X have been stripped out. Conversely we say
	 * that B is a syntactic abstraction of A relative to variable
	 * X. Obviously here the variables of interest will be joint
	 * variables between A and B. The idea of establishing a
	 * variable-relative-specialization between components is to
	 * guaranty that the number of possible values that can be chosen
	 * so that the two variable occurences equate is bounded by the
	 * number of values of the variable occurence of the more abstract
	 * component. If no such relationship exists, then the number of
	 * possible values is bounded by the size of the database,
	 * which is usually higher than the actually value, and thus often
	 * a poor basis for an estimate. By performing a purely syntactic
	 * analysis the estimate can be greatly enhenced. Since the
	 * analysis is purely syntactic it does not diminish the measure of
	 * surprisingness of the pattern relative to the database. I.e. it
	 * adequatly discounts in the surprisingness measure the
	 * surprisingness of the pattern alone.
	 *
	 * ## Examples
	 *
	 * ### First Example
	 *
	 * pattern
	 * =
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y
	 *   And
	 *     Inheritance X Y
	 *     Inheritance F Y
	 *     Inheritance G X
	 *
	 * Let's consider a partition of 3 components/blocks, each clause
	 * is a block.
	 *
	 * A = Inheritance X Y
	 * B = Inheritance F Y
	 * C = Inheritance G X
	 *
	 * All variables of this partition are joint (F and G are
	 * constants). However relative to X components A and C are
	 * independent, while relative to Y component B is a specialization
	 * of component A.
	 *
	 * Let's rewrite the component variables by explicitly showing
	 * variable occurences in components
	 *
	 * A = Inheritance X1 Y1
	 * B = Inheritance F Y2
	 * C = Inheritance G X2
	 *
	 * The specialization relationship between A and B relative to Y
	 * allows us to infer that V(Y2) is a subset of V(Y1). Thus the
	 * number of possible values that Y2 can take is bounded by
	 * |V(Y1)|.
	 *
	 * Let's calculate P(X1=X2) and P(Y1=Y2) for this pattern.
	 *
	 * P(X1=X2) = 1/|U| * 1/|U| * |U|
	 *          = 1/|U|
	 *
	 * the first 1/|U| is because each value of X1 can be any value of
	 * the universe U. The second 1/|U| is because, and since A and C
	 * are independent relative to X, each value of X2 can also be any
	 * value of U. Then we multiple by |U| because the equality may
	 * occur for each possible value of X1 or X2, so the probabilities
	 * add up. Now for P(Y1=Y2)
	 *
	 * P(Y1=Y2) = 1/|U| * 1/|V(Y1)| * |U|
	 *          = 1/|V(Y1)|
	 *
	 * 1/|U| is because Y1 in the more abstract component A can take
	 * any value of U. For any value of Y1 however, Y2 can only take a
	 * value of V(Y1) since B is a specialization of A relative to
	 * Y. Then we multiple by |U| to add up all probabilities for each
	 * values of the more abstract component A.
	 *
	 * ### Second Example
	 *
	 * pattern
	 * =
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y Z
	 *   And
	 *     Inheritance X Y
	 *     Inheritance Z Y
	 *
	 * Assuming a partition of the 2 components
	 *
	 * A = Inheritance X Y
	 * B = Inheritance Z Y
	 *
	 * Thus after explicitly showing variable occurences
	 *
	 * A = Inheritance X Y1
	 * B = Inheritance Z Y2
	 *
	 * P(Y1=Y2) = 1/|U| * 1/|V(Y1)| * |U|
	 *          = 1/|V(Y1)|
	 *
	 * Here A and B are actually equivalent relative to Y, meaning the
	 * specialization relationship must not be strict.
	 *
	 * ### Third Example
	 *
	 * pattern
	 * =
	 * Lambda
	 *   X Y Z W
	 *   And
	 *     List X Y X
	 *     List Z W X
	 *
	 * Assuming a partition of the 2 components
	 *
	 * A = List X Y X
	 * B = List Z W X
	 *
	 * Thus after explicitly showing variable occurences
	 *
	 * A = List X1 Y X1
	 * B = List Z W X2
	 *
	 * P(X1=X2) = 1/|U| * 1/|V(X2)| * |U| = 1/|V(X2)|
	 *
	 * It doesn't matter that X1 appears twice in A, the number values
	 * it can take is still bounded by its most specialized abstraction
	 * relative to X, that is B.
	 *
	 * ## General formula
	 *
	 * Let X be a variable, with n variable occurences X1, ..., Xn in
	 * the respective components C1, ..., Cn. Without loss of
	 * generality let's assume that C1, ..., Cn are ordered such that
	 * if Ci is strictly more abstract than Cj relative to X, then
	 * i<j. This admits many orders as it doesn't impose restrictions
	 * on components that are equivalent or independent.  But it
	 * doesn't matter as it is only used to avoid cycles in the
	 * calculation of the probability estimate. Then the general
	 * formula is
	 *
	 * P(X1=...=Xn) = Prod_{j=2}^n 1/M(Xj)
	 *
	 * where M(Xj) is either
	 *
	 * 1. |V(Xi)|, the count of Xi in the most specialized component Ci
	 * that is either more abstract than or equivalent to Cj relative
	 * to X and such that i<j.
	 *
	 * 2. |U|, if no such more abstract or equivalent component exists
	 * for Xj.
	 *
	 * A proof sketch of why it is a good estimate of P(X1=...=Xn)
	 * (under independence assumption of the data) is that the
	 * syntactic specialization relationship provides a prior to
	 * discard distributions (i.e. set their prior probabilities to 0)
	 * of values of variable occurences Xi using subset relationships
	 * between V(Xi) and V(Xj).
	 *
	 * One last remark: The count |V(Xi)| can be exact or approximated.
	 * Of course the estimate will be better if the count is exact.
	 * Since such count is only consider component by component, and
	 * interactions are never used to obtain that count, having an
	 * exact count does not invalidate the surprisingness measure.
	 * However it can be computationally costly, so an option is to
	 * approximate it.  One possible approximation under independence
	 * assumptions is as follows.  Assume the component has N
	 * variables, if these variables are completely independent then
	 * the number of values of each of them is the N-th root of the
	 * component support S
	 *
	 * |V(Xi)| ~= Nth-root(S)
	 *
	 * such that the final support can be obtained by multiplying the
	 * number of values of all variables of that component.
	 *
	 * As of today the code calculates the exact count (thus is rather
	 * slow). We have not experimented with approximated counts yet.
